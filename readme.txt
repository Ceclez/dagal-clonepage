// -- DESCRIPTION -- //
LANDING PAGE PROJECT, A CLONE OF THE DAGAL PORTAL WITH SOME CHANGES.

1. STYLES WERE CREATED USING SASS. THE BASE FILE INCLUDES THE DECLARATION OF VARIABLES,
MIXINS, AND MEDIA QUERIES, EACH IN THEIR OWN FILE.
2. 'LAYOUT' CONTAINS THE GENERAL STYLES, DESING, AND STRUCTURE OF THE ENTIRE LANDING PAGE.
3. FOR RESPONSIVE DESIGN, MEDIA QUERIES ARE NAMED ACCORDING TO THE TARGET WIDTH. FOR EXAMPLE:
'@include width-850 {}' FOR THE SCREENS WITH A WIDTH LESS THAN 850px.
4. THE FORM HAS NO FUNCTIONAL EFFECT, ITS PURELY AESTHETIC.
